# sparsebn

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/itsrainingdata/sparsebn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/itsrainingdata/sparsebn)

Methods for learning sparse Bayesian networks and other graphical models from
high-dimensional data via sparse regularization. Designed to handle:

- Experimental data with interventions 
- Mixed observational / experimental data
- High-dimensional data with _p >> n_
- Datasets with thousands of variables (tested up to _p_=8000)
- Continuous and discrete data

The workhorse behind `sparsebn` is the [`sparsebnUtils`](http://www.github.com/itsrainingdata/sparsebnUtils/)
package, which provides various S3 classes and methods for representing and manipulating graphs. The basic algorithms are implemented in [`ccdrAlgorithm`](http://www.github.com/itsrainingdata/ccdrAlgorithm/) and [`discretecdAlgorithm`](http://www.github.com/gujyjean/discretecdAlgorithm/).

## Overview

The main methods for learning graphical models are:

* `estimate.dag` for directed acyclic graphs (Bayesian networks).
* `estimate.precision` for undirected graphs (Markov random fields).
* `estimate.covariance` for covariance matrices.

## Installation

You can install:

* the latest CRAN version with

    ```R
    install.packages("sparsebn")
    ````

* the latest development version from GitHub with

    ```R
    devtools::install_github(c("itsrainingdata/sparsebn/", "itsrainingdata/sparsebnUtils/dev", "itsrainingdata/ccdrAlgorithm/dev", "gujyjean/discretecdAlgorithm"))
    ```
